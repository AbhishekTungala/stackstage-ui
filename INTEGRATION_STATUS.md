## Technical Implementation

### Backend Structure
```
backend/
├── main.py                 # FastAPI app
├── utils/ai_engine.py      # OpenRouter integration  
├── routers/
│   ├── analyze.py         # Analysis endpoints
│   ├── assistant.py       # Chat endpoints
│   └── export.py          # PDF export
└── models/schemas.py      # Data validation
```

### Integration Flow
```
Frontend → Express.js (port 5000) → Python Backend Functions → OpenRouter API → Response
```

## User Experience

### Analysis Page
- Users input architecture descriptions
- Real AI analysis with intelligent insights
- Professional scoring and recommendations
- Mermaid diagrams for visualization

### Assistant Page  
- Interactive chat with cloud architecture expert
- Contextual responses with conversation memory
- Dynamic suggestions for follow-up questions
- Professional technical guidance

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Frontend Enhancement**: Update loading states to show "Analyzing with AI..." instead of generic loading
2. **Real-time Features**: Add typing indicators for chat
3. **Export Integration**: Connect PDF export button to backend endpoint
4. **Analytics**: Track usage and response quality

## Current Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL ✅

The AI backend is successfully replacing mock data with real intelligence. Both analysis and assistant features are providing authentic, high-quality responses using OpenRouter's GPT-4o-mini model.
