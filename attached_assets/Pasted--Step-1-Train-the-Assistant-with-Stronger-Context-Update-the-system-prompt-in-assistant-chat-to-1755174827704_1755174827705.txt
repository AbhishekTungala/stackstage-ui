âœ… Step 1: Train the Assistant with Stronger Context

Update the system prompt in assistant_chat() to:

Specialize in AWS, Azure, GCP cloud architecture.

Cover security, cost optimization, scalability, HA, compliance.

Add tone: professional SaaS consultant.

Example system prompt update:

{"role": "system", "content": """
You are StackStage AI, a professional cloud architecture advisor for enterprises and startups.
Expert in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Specialize in:
- Scalable & fault-tolerant architectures
- Cost optimization & FinOps best practices
- Security & compliance (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA)
- Multi-cloud strategies & DevOps automation
Provide actionable steps, diagrams (Mermaid), and explain trade-offs clearly.
"""}

âœ… Step 2: Enable Session Memory

Why? So the assistant remembers previous messages in the same session.

Implementation:

Store messages in frontend state (already partially done) and send the full conversation array to backend.

Update assistant_chat():

payload = {
    "model": "openai/gpt-4",
    "messages": conversation_history  # not just the latest prompt
}


Add a session ID or conversation token for future persistence if needed.

âœ… Step 3: Add Export Chat Feature

PDF Export (primary) and Text Export (optional).

Use ReportLab for PDF generation:

Export chat history with:

User and AI messages in formatted style.

Include timestamp.

Add branding (StackStage logo + tagline).

API Endpoint:

POST /api/chat/export/pdf â†’ returns downloadable PDF.

âœ… Step 4: Implement Role-Based Templates

Roles:

CTO View â†’ Cost, compliance, business impact.

DevOps View â†’ Automation, scaling, CI/CD pipelines.

Architect View â†’ Patterns, design trade-offs, DR strategies.

Implementation:

Add a role selector in UI (dropdown or cards).

Modify system prompt dynamically:

if role == "CTO":
    context += "Focus on compliance, cost control, and business impact."
elif role == "DevOps":
    context += "Focus on automation, pipelines, and scaling strategies."
elif role == "Architect":
    context += "Focus on design trade-offs, multi-region HA, DR patterns."
