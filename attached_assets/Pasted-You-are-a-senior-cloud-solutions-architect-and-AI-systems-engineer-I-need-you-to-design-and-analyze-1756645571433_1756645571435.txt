You are a senior cloud solutions architect and AI systems engineer. I need you to design and analyze a **multi-cloud, AI-powered backend system** with the following requirements:

### Core Features:
1. **AI Assistant Module**
   - Uses OpenRouter API with model: `perplexity/llama-3-sonar-large-32k-online`
   - Handles advanced analysis and recommendations.
   - Real-time inference with caching layer for optimization.

2. **Visualization**
   - Integrate **Mermaid.js diagrams** for architecture visualization.
   - Include real-time data charts (e.g., system load, AI usage, cost tracking).

3. **Multi-Cloud Deployment**
   - AWS (EKS for Kubernetes, S3, RDS)
   - GCP (GKE, Cloud SQL)
   - Azure (AKS, Blob Storage)
   - Provide **cost-effective failover strategy**.

4. **Geo-Location Detection**
   - Detect user location (MaxMind GeoIP or similar).
   - Route requests to nearest cloud region for low latency.

5. **Real-Time Data Analysis**
   - Stream data from multiple sources (Kafka or AWS Kinesis).
   - Perform real-time metrics computation for dashboards.

6. **Security**
   - End-to-end encryption.
   - Mutual TLS between microservices.
   - JWT-based authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
   - AWS WAF integration for DDoS and OWASP protections.

7. **Scalability & Monitoring**
   - Kubernetes for container orchestration.
   - Horizontal Pod Autoscaling for AI inference services.
   - Observability with Prometheus + Grafana or AWS CloudWatch.
   - Log aggregation with ELK or OpenSearch.

### What I Need in Your Response:
✔ **Detailed Architecture Overview**
✔ **Mermaid Diagram for the entire system**
✔ **Deployment Workflow (CI/CD pipeline steps)**
✔ **Exact Tech Stack Selection**
✔ **Cost Breakdown per Cloud Provider (AWS, GCP, Azure)**
✔ **Estimated Cost for AI usage (OpenRouter)**
✔ **Performance Optimization Recommendations**
✔ **Security Best Practices**
✔ **Multi-Cloud Failover Strategy**
✔ **Database Design for AI logs, user data, and metrics**
✔ **Integration steps for AI model (Llama3 Sonar) with Replit backend**

### Output Format:
1. **High-Level Summary**
2. **Architecture Analysis with Score**
3. **Cost Analysis (Monthly Estimate)**
4. **Mermaid Diagram**
5. **Deployment Plan**
6. **Risk & Performance Recommendations**

Your response should be **complete and production-grade**, as if presenting to a CTO.
