    "The S3 bucket is configured with 'force_destroy = true', which allows for the deletion of the bucket even if it contains objects, posing a risk of accidental data loss.",
    "The bucket lacks versioning, which is essential for data recovery and protection against accidental deletions.",
    "There are no bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) defined, which could lead to unauthorized access if the bucket is publicly accessible.",
